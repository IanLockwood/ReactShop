## Reflections
I actually spent about 5 or 6 hours on this, because I got too excited about fun, unnecessary stuff! I honestly got really into styling, and I even added a somewhat complex feature that was not asked for (live updating number-of-items-in-cart, which supports quantity per item). However, if you remove that and styling, I'd say I came in at about 3.5 hours.

In fact, I actually left off a single requirement: "The user should be able to view an item." I didn't miss this requirement, and with more time I would definitely add it. But since there was no novel code functionality in there (adding items to cart, incrementing/decrementing, deleting cart items, completing the order), I decided to be honest about time and leave it off.

More things I would add with more time, in order:

Comments - I did not have time to comment anything, but by the time you get to my code you'll probably see them. That's because I can't stand un-commented code and I'm about to add them after typing this Readme, but I wanted to be honest about that. Usually I'd comment as I went along but I was pressed for time!

Tests - Next up would be tests. Every good project needs a ton of testing, and I'd usually have at least a few tests per component, but again, time. You may see tests by the time you read this. But with recommended project times it's usually an easy casualty!

Edge Cases - There are so, so many edge cases that could destroy this code. If I was really building GrubHub this would take weeks, mainly because of all of the edge cases, type checking, etc. Which brings me to...

TypeScript! I didn't use it because I know it would've added a lot of time since I'm a little rusty, but my gosh, the type checking alone that TypeScript provides would eliminate 70% of the edge cases here. It would be really, really valuable.

Component Architecture - As I hustled to get this done I dropped some of my organization, I wasn't as thorough as I would have been but I did an okay job. JSX would probably be separated out way more, I'd make some hooks, and I'd split most of these components into 2.

That's it! Thanks so much for the fun project.
